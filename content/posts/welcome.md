Welcome! My name is Roberto Garc√≠a Calero, I'm a Software
Engineering student at the University of Seville and also a proud member
of Geographica, an awesome location intelligence company!

I want to introduce you Sento, my Undergraduate Thesis Project.

## The idea

Sento, _sentiment_ in Esperanto, will be the combination of the sentiment
analysis teachings I will learn during this year and the professional
experience I'm gaining as a GIS (Geographic Information System)
engineer at my job. It will also be a new ground for trying out new
programming languages and libre/open source technologies.

Sento will be a desktop web application which provides its users
insights about how Twitter users have reacted to current trending
topics. The information will be presented on top of a map, giving
the possibility to observe diffrences on how a person reacts to a topic
based on where he/she lives and also see how the relevance of a topic
might change depending of the region.

## The workflow

This is a very simple outline of how Sento will work:

1. Sento will collect tweets from the trending topics of a country.
2. The collected tweets will be processed using sentiment analysis techniques.
3. The processing results will be stored in a convinient way for them to be
published through an API.
4. The API will serve the results to the users who accessed the app.
5. The app's frontend will render the results.

## Closing

After a brief introduction to the idea of Sento, I would like to share with
you an interesting musical map!
