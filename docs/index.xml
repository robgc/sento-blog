      <description>Welcome! My name is Roberto García Calero, I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineering student at the University of Seville and also a proud member of Geographica, an awesome location intelligence company!
I want to introduce you Sento, my Undergraduate Thesis Project.
The idea Sento, sentiment in Esperanto, will be the combination of the sentiment analysis teachings I will learn during this year and the professional experience I&amp;rsquo;m gaining as a GIS (Geographic Information System) engineer at my job.</description>
